# Highlights
These are the programs I created that I am the most proud of.

### Invented-Algorithm
Implements an algorithm entirely invented by myself to calculate the biodiversity of a biological sample. The calculation involves building a tree based on the sample and weighting each edge of the tree, such that adding up all edges with their given weight yields a calculation of diversity. The edges are weighted based on how skewed the subtrees connected by the edges are in relation to one another.

### Wordle
Takes the user through a fully functional game of Wordle via the terminal. A user guesses a 5 letter word picked by the program at random, and is informed of which letters are correctly placed, which letters are in the program chosen word but not in the correct position, and which letters are not in the program chosen word. The user has six guesses to find the secret word. This projects are meant to be run in the IntelliJ IDE. I am responsible for the full creation of all this projects.
