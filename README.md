These are the programs I created that I am the most proud of.

### Invented-Algorithm
Implements an algorithm entirely invented by myself to calculate the biodiversity of a biological sample. The calculation involves building a tree based on the sample and weighting each edge of the tree, such that adding up all edges with their given weight yields a calculation of diversity. The edges are weighted based on how skewed the subtrees connected by the edges are in relation to one another.
