I did everything myself. 

No known bugs are errors.

Using j-unit and a test class called "MyMazeTest.java", I wrote five branch tests for:
makeMaze
printMaze
solveMaze
determineSolutionViability
determinePrintStatus



I wrote extra tests, because I didnâ€™t want to get docked points in case something was wrong with a couple.

The print maze method is different from the one showed in class, but the output is the same.
